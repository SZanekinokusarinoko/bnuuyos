[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/60-percent-of-the-time-works-every-time.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

bnuuyOS is a meta-distribution utilizing MATE to create a easy and aesthetically pleasing system for daily use.
There are three versions of bnuuyOS: Luna, Aqua, and Micro.

> What is the base distro?

Luna and Aqua are based around (Linux Mint's MATE variant)[https://linuxmint.com/], although it could theoretically be replicated on other distros with support for the MATE desktop environment. There are also plans for a (Debian)[https://www.debian.org/]/(Devuan)[https://www.devuan.org/] release to allow support for x86/32-bit machines.
The Micro version is designed around (Alpine Linux)[https://www.alpinelinux.org/], and is designed to be a lightweigt alternative to the heavier Luna and Aqua (even though it takes after Luna more than Aqua.)
